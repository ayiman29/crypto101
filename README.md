# Crypto101 Python Implementations

This repository contains my personal implementations and practice exercises of fundamental cryptographic algorithms and protocols in Python. The code is based on concepts from the book *Crypto101* and other resources, aimed at deepening my understanding of cryptography for my thesis work in cybersecurity.


**N.B.:** All implementations are done manually from scratch without relying on external cryptographic libraries, to deepen understanding of the underlying algorithms and mathematics.

## Purpose

This repo serves as my hands-on playground to:

- Implement my cryptographic knowledge practically on python.
- Develop a clear understanding of both the mathematical concepts and the coding.
- Keep track of my learning progress(and enjoy the GitHub green boxes for a dopamine rushü§©)

## How to Use 

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto101.git
   cd crypto101
   ```

2. Run individual scripts to test implementations. For example:

   ```bash
   python sha256.py
   python h_mac.py
   ```

3. Study the source code for detailed comments and explanations.

## My Learning Process

* Learned the basics of cryptography from the book Crypto101 ‚Äî an introductory guide to cryptography.
* Asked ChatGPT to provide Python skeletons with step-by-step outlines, without explicit code.
* Solved the coding problems myself, using online resources or ChatGPT for help when stuck.

## About

* Author: Me, duh! 
* Inspired by the book [*Crypto101*](https://crypto101.io/) ‚Äî an introductory cryptography book freely available online.
* Field of study: Cybersecurity (Thesis research focus)
